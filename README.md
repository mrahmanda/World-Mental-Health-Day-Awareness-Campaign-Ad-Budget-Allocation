# World-Mental-Health-Day-Awareness-Campaign-Ad-Budget-Allocation

## Context
We have an allotted budget of $X to spend on social media ads for the upcoming global awareness campaign for World Mental Health Day. In order to bring awareness of mental health to the audiences that could benefit the most, we have chosen to optimize our budget based on data on the prevalence of mental health disorders.


The analysis below outlines the insights about mental health prevalence and methodology for allocating our budget.
###Â Dataset
Our dataset is from the Global Burden of Disease Study (2019) from the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation. As described on their website: https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.healthdata.org/research-analysis/gbd&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1719469654754852&usg=AOvVaw3myWiSpDfG-dD34y2kp67s


The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study provides a comprehensive picture of mortality and disability across countries, time, age, and sex. It quantifies health loss from hundreds of diseases, injuries, and risk factors, so that health systems can be improved and disparities eliminated.


The dataset covers 204 countries and includes the estimated number and percentage of people who are diagnosed with mental disorders, broken down by demographics segments.


The columns included are:

### Metric:
Percent: percent of the population diagnosed
Number: number of people diagnosed
### Location:
Global
By country
### Age:
All ages
Children: 0-9 years old
Teens: 10-19 years old
Adults: 20-54 years old
Elders: 55+ years old
### Sex:
Both sexes
Male
Female

### Methodology
We chose to target audiences with a higher mental health prevalence. While there is the issue of underdiagnosis for mental health disorders, we reasoned that the statistical estimation model created for the study may try to account for it.
We used spreadsheets for this analysis.
